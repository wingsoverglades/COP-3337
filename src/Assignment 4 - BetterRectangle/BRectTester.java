|  
|   Description:    The goal of this program is to reinvent the rectangle
|                   class and fix some of its shortcomming.
|                  
|   Input:          No user input
|  
|   Output:         The user should expect the toString output of all tested
|                   rectangles and any other relevant information pertaining to
|                   the specific rectangles being tested.
|  
|   Process:        The BetterRectangle class makes extensive use of basic
|                   geometric formulas that were provided in the specifications
|                   by professor William Feild.
|  
|   Required Features Not Included:  
|                   [If the assignment specifies a feature that you were unable
|                   to include in the program, mention that omission here.
|                   Otherwise, state that you were able to include all of the
|                   required features in your program. Being honest here may
|                   save you some points.]  
|  
|   Known Bugs:     [If you know of any problems with the code, provide details
|                   here; otherwise, clearly state that you know of no logic
|                   errors. Being honest here may save you some points.]
